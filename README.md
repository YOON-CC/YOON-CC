## ðŸ”— About Me
- I enjoy challenging development to break through the limits of web development such as bulletin board expansion.
- I have been involved in many external activities to expand the user-centered perspective, and have won more than 8 awards.
- I enjoy growing together with us through four or more team leader experiences.
- I am proud that my personal project, DREAMMAKER, is a project that has pushed the limits of the web front.
- I believe that growth comes from taking on challenges. My current concern is optimization.
